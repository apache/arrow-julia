# Release

## Overview

  1. Test the revision to be released
  2. Increment version number in `Project.toml`
  3. Prepare RC and vote (detailed later)
  4. Publish (detailed later)

### Prepare RC and vote

Run `dev/release/release_rc.sh` on working copy of `git@github.com:apache/arrow-julia` not your fork:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:apache/arrow-julia.git
$ dev/release/release_rc.sh ${RC}
(Send a vote email to dev@arrow.apache.org.
 You can use a draft shown by release_rc.sh for the email.)
```

Here is an example to release RC1:

```console
$ dev/release/release_rc.sh 1
```

The argument of `release_rc.sh` is the RC number. If RC1 has a problem, we'll increment the RC number such as RC2, RC3 and so on.

Requirements to run `release_rc.sh`:

  * You must be an Apache Arrow committer or PMC member
  * You must prepare your PGP key for signing

If you don't have a PGP key, https://infra.apache.org/release-signing.html#generate may be helpful.

Your PGP key must be registered to the followings:

  * https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/arrow/KEYS
  * https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/arrow/KEYS

See the header comment of them how to add a PGP key.

Apache arrow committers can update them by Subversion client with their ASF account. e.g.:

```console
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/arrow
$ cd arrow
$ editor KEYS
$ svn ci KEYS
```

### Publish

We need to do the followings to publish a new release:

  * Publish to apache.org
  * Publish to the Julia General registry

Run `dev/release/release.sh` to publish to apache.org:

```console
$ dev/release/release.sh ${VERSION} ${RC}
```

Here is an example to release 2.2.1 RC1:

```console
$ dev/release/release.sh 2.2.1 1
```

Add the release to ASF's report database via [Apache Committee Report Helper](https://reporter.apache.org/addrelease.html?arrow).

To publish the release to the Julia General registry, navigate to the GitHub commit where the project version was incremented in the Project.toml file (step 2 above), then post a comment on the commit with the following:

`@JuliaRegistrator register()`

JuliaRegistrator will respond saying it has opened a pull request to the General registry and under normal circumstances, will be merged automatically.

### Verify

We have a script to verify a RC.

You must install the following commands to use the script:

  * `curl`
  * `gpg`
  * `shasum` or `sha256sum`/`sha512sum`
  * `tar`

You don't need to install Julia. If there isn't Julia in system, the latest Julia is automatically installed only for verification.

To verify a RC, run the following command line:

```console
$ dev/release/verify_rc.sh ${VERSION} ${RC}
```

Here is an example to release 2.2.1 RC1:

```console
$ dev/release/verify_rc.sh 2.2.1 1
```

If the verification is succeeded, `RC looks good!` is shown.
