WriteVtable serializes the vtable for the current object, if applicable.

Before writing out the vtable, this checks pre-existing vtables for equality
to this one. If an equal vtable is found, point the object to the existing
vtable and return.

Because vtable values are sensitive to alignment of object data, not all
logically-equal vtables will be deduplicated.

A vtable has the following format:
<VOffsetT: size of the vtable in bytes, including this value>
<VOffsetT: size of the object in bytes, including the vtable offset>
<VOffsetT: offset for a field> * N, where N is the number of fields in
the schema for this type. Includes deprecated fields.
Thus, a vtable is made of 2 + N elements, each SizeVOffsetT bytes wide.
