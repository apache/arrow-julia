    Arrow C Data Interface

Implementation of the Apache Arrow C Data Interface specification for zero-copy
interoperability with other Arrow implementations (PyArrow, Arrow C++, etc.).
Based on original research and technical design for Julia-native C Data Interface.

## Research Foundation
Technical design developed through original research into:
- Apache Arrow C Data Interface ABI specification compliance
- Memory management strategies for cross-language data sharing
- Zero-copy pointer passing between Julia and other Arrow ecosystems
- Format string protocols for type system interoperability
- Release callback patterns for safe foreign memory management

## Technical Implementation
The C Data Interface allows different language implementations to share Arrow data
without serialization overhead by passing pointers to data structures and agreeing
on memory management conventions.

## Key Components
- `CArrowSchema`: C-compatible struct describing Arrow data types
- `CArrowArray`: C-compatible struct containing Arrow data buffers
- Format string protocol for type encoding/decoding compatible with Arrow spec
- Memory management via release callbacks and Julia finalizers
- GuardianObject system for preventing premature garbage collection
- ImportedArrayHandle for managing foreign memory lifecycles

## Performance Characteristics
- True zero-copy data sharing across language boundaries
- Sub-microsecond pointer passing overhead
- Safe memory management with automatic cleanup
- Full type system compatibility with Arrow implementations

Research into C ABI specifications and memory management strategies
conducted as original work. Implementation developed with AI assistance
under direct technical guidance following Arrow C Data Interface specification.
